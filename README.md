# Slurm tools

These Slurm tools have been developed for management and monitoring of our cluster:

1. ```pestat``` Prints a Slurm cluster nodes status with 1 line per node and job info.

2. ```slurmreportmonth``` Generate monthly accounting statistics from Slurm using the sreport command.

3. ```showuserjobs``` Print the current node status and batch jobs status broken down into userids.
