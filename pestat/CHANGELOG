version 0.50. Date: 22 June 2017
--------------------------------

I discovered how to obtain the node Free Memory with sinfo, so now we can do nice things with memory usage!

New features:

1. The "pestat -f" will flag nodes with less than 20% free memory.

2. Now "pestat -m 1000" will print nodes with less than 1000 MB free memory.

3. Use "pestat -M 200000" to print nodes with greater than 200000 MB free memory.  Jobs on such under-utilized nodes might better be submitted to lower-memory nodes. 

version 0.41. Date: 15 June 2017
--------------------------------

Colored output is now printed also when all nodes are listed, and the logic has been cleaned up a bit. 

version 0.40. Date: 09 May 2017
