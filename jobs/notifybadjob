You may want to consult the Niflheim Wiki page about batch job information:
$INFOURL

In the following we display various pieces of information about your badly behaving batch job.

Slurm batch system information about job id $JOB:
---------------------------------------------------

EOF

# Copy the job status info from Slurm
cat $JOBMSGS >> $MESSAGE

# Is the job still in a queued state ?
JOBSTATE=`grep JobState= $JOBMSGS | awk '{print $1}'`
echo NOTE: This job has a state of $JOBSTATE

fi

# Only print job information for running jobs
if test "$JOBQUEUED" = 0
then
	# Memory and CPU usage
	# cat <<EOF >> $MESSAGE
	cat <<EOF >> /dev/null

RAM-memory usage and CPU-load usage of your job on the job nodes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Please look at these usage numbers to determine why the job was behaving badly
(note especially items marked by *): 

  node state  load    pmem ncpu   mem   resi usrs tasks  jobids/users 
EOF

	# Print job memory and CPU usage by pestat (local command)
	# echo -n RAM and CPU usage...
	# $PESTAT | grep $JOB >> $MESSAGE
	# cat <<EOF >> $MESSAGE
	cat <<EOF >> /dev/null

Explanation of some columns in the usage list:
node: The compute node running your job.
load: The CPU load average (should not exceed the number of physical CPUs).
pmem: Physical memory (MB) in the node.
ncpu: Number of physical CPUs in the node.
resi: Resident memory (MB) in use (should not exceed the physical memory pmem by too much).
EOF

	# Information about the job processes on the nodes
	cat <<EOF >> $MESSAGE

Process information on the nodes of your job.
---------------------------------------------

Please look at these processes to determine why the job was behaving badly:

Information about files in job working directory
------------------------------------------------

This directory contains $NUMFILESINDIR files in total.
Newest files in this directory are (max. $MAXFILES files):

EOF
		ls -lt $WORKDIR | head -$MAXFILES >> $MESSAGE

Information about files in job working directory
